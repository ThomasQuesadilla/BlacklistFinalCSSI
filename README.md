# BlacklistFinalCSSI
Repository for CSSI final project


There are two parts to our repository:
   - Website
   - Extension

The website allows you to download the extension, as well as teaching the user how to install it onto their chrome.

The extension itself redacts certain keywords that may trigger trauma victims and, eventually, be fully customizable by the user.
